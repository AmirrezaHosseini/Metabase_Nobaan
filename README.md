Set up in five minutes (we're not kidding).
Let anyone on your team ask questions without knowing SQL.
Use the SQL editor for more complex queries.
Build handsome, interactive dashboards with filters, auto-refresh, fullscreen, and custom click behavior.
Create models that clean up, annotate, and/or combine raw tables.
Define canonical segments and metrics for your team to use.
Send data to Slack or email on a schedule with dashboard subscriptions.
Set up alerts to have Metabase notify you when your data changes.
Embed charts and dashboards in your app, or even your entire Metabase.
